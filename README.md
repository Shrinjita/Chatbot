## Files Overview

1. **`llama_chatbot.py`**
   - A Streamlit application that allows users to interact with the LLaMA model. Users need to input their Hugging Face token, provide a prompt, and set parameters for response generation.

2. **`app.py`**
   - A similar Streamlit application with the same functionality as `llama_chatbot.py`. This file serves as an alternative implementation and can be used interchangeably.

## Prerequisites

Before running the applications, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher

## Environment Setup

To run the chatbot application effectively, it's essential to set up a virtual environment. This ensures that all dependencies are isolated and prevents conflicts with other projects. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   You can create a virtual environment using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv chatbot-env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     chatbot-env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source chatbot-env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the requirements:**
   After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run It on Your Own Machine

1. **Run the app:**

   For `llama_chatbot.py`:

   ```bash
   streamlit run llama_chatbot.py
   ```

   For `app.py`:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Enter your Hugging Face Token:**
   - When prompted, input your Hugging Face token in the provided field. This token is necessary for accessing the LLaMA model.
   - **Note:** The LLaMA model is part of a gated community on Hugging Face. To access it, you may need to apply for access on their website and provide details about your intended use case. Once approved, you will receive a token that you can use in this application.

3. **Provide a prompt:**
   - Type your query or prompt in the designated input box.

4. **Set the parameters:**
   - Adjust the sliders for:
     - Max Tokens (range: 50-300)
     - Temperature (range: 0.0-1.0)
     - Top P (range: 0.0-1.0)

5. **Generate a response:**
   - Click the "Generate Response" button to receive a reply from the LLaMA model based on your input.

## Error Handling

- If there are issues loading the model, appropriate error messages will be displayed.
- Ensure that the Hugging Face token is valid and has the necessary permissions.
