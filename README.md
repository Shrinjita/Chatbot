## Files Overview

1. **`llama_chatbot.py`**
   - A Streamlit application that allows users to interact with the LLaMA model. Users need to input their Hugging Face token, provide a prompt, and set parameters for response generation.

2. **`app.py`**
   - A similar Streamlit application with the same functionality as `llama_chatbot.py`. This file serves as an alternative implementation and can be used interchangeably.

## Prerequisites

Before running the applications, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher

## Environment Setup

To run the chatbot application effectively, it's essential to set up a virtual environment. This ensures that all dependencies are isolated and prevents conflicts with other projects. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   You can create a virtual environment using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv chatbot-env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     chatbot-env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source chatbot-env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the requirements:**
   After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run It on Your Own Machine

1. **Run the app:**

   For `llama_chatbot.py`:

   ```bash
   streamlit run llama_chatbot.py
   ```

   For `app.py`:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Enter your Hugging Face Token:**
   - When prompted, input your Hugging Face token in the provided field. This token is necessary for accessing the LLaMA model.

3. **Provide a prompt:**
   - Type your query or prompt in the designated input box.

4. **Set the parameters:**
   - Adjust the sliders for:
     - Max Tokens (range: 50-300)
     - Temperature (range: 0.0-1.0)
     - Top P (range: 0.0-1.0)

5. **Generate a response:**
   - Click the "Generate Response" button to receive a reply from the LLaMA model based on your input.

## Error Handling

- If there are issues loading the model, appropriate error messages will be displayed.
- Ensure that the Hugging Face token is valid and has the necessary permissions.
